#Â appJar Settings

appJar can remember various GUI settings, and restore them on launch.  

## Settings

appJar will store the following settings:

```sh
[GEOM]
    # geometry = string: size, location
    # fullscreen = boolean: True/False
    # minsize = string: x,y
    # state = string: withdrawn/zoomed
[TOOLBAR]
    # pinned = boolean: True/False

[TOGGLES]
    # name = boolean: True/False
[TABS]
    # name = string: selected tab
[PAGES]
    # name = string: selected page

[SUBWINDOWS]
    # name = boolean: True/False
[SUBWINDOW_NAME]
    # geometry = string: size, location
    # fullscreen = boolean: True/False
    # minsize = string: x,y
    # state = string: withdrawn/zoomed

[EXTERNAL]
    # name = string: value
```

## Usage  
---

* `gui(useSettings=False)`  
    Set this flag to `True` in the constructor to enable settings.  
    This will cause them to be loaded & saved automatically.  

* `.loadSettings(fileName="appJar.ini", useSettings=True)`  
    This function can be called manually if you want to load settings at a later time.  
    An alternative file can be specified.  
    If `useSettings` is set to False, appjar won't save the settings back at the end.  

* `.saveSettings(fileName="appJar.ini")`  
    This will save the current settings, with an optional file name.  

* `.getSetting(name, default=None)`  
    This allows you to request a user setting of the specified name.  
    If no setting is found, the `default` value will be returned.  

* `.setSetting(name, value)`  
    This will store the named setting, with the specified value.  
    You must make sure settings are being saved, for this to take effect.  

## Command Line Arguments  
---

It's possible to switch on settings from the command line.  
Simply use the `-s` flag, with an optional  file name:  

```sh
python3 themes.py -s  # turn on settings
```
Turn on settings, with a specified filename:  
```sh
python3 themes.py -s myFile.txt  # turn on settings with a specified filename
```
