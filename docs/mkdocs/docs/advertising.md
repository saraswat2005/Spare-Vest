# Advertising
---

The only direct cost incurred through creating/maintaining appJar is the domain name registration.  

However, hundreds of hours have been invested into coding and documenting the project.  

So, as of version 0.90, some advertising has been introduced to the documentation site, to help keep the project running.  

I've worked hard to make this as unobtrusive as possible - an ad in the footer, and one or two inline ads in the longer pages.  

If you have some kind of ad blocker running, you won't see the ads, although an empty ad block might appear.  

## Supporting appJar  
---

If you'd like to help support appJar, please consider adding us to your ad blocker's whitelist.  

Here's how to do it in the ad blockers I use:

* **AdBlock** (Mac/Safari)  
    Click the **AdBlock icon** -> Options -> Customize.  
    Click **Show ads on a webpage or domain**, type `http://appjar.info`, and press **OK**  

* **uBlock** (Raspberry Pi/Chromium)  
    Right-click the **uBlock icon** (top right) -> Options -> Whitelist  
    Type `appjar.info`, and press **Apply changes**
