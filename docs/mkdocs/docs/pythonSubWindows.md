# Sub Window  
---  
A way to add additional windows, which can be hidden and shown.  

![SubWindow](img/layouts/subWin.png)

```python
from appJar import gui 

def launch(win):
    app.showSubWindow(win)

app=gui()

# these go in the main window
app.addButtons(["one", "two"], launch)

# this is a pop-up
app.startSubWindow("one", modal=True)
app.addLabel("l1", "SubWindow One")
app.stopSubWindow()

# this is another pop-up
app.startSubWindow("two")
app.addLabel("l2", "SubWindow Two")
app.stopSubWindow()

app.go()
```

Definition of SubWindows happens in the same part of the code as the rest of the GUI, but they default to being hidden.  
Both SubWindows and the main window can be *shown* and *hidden* - this is usually done through button presses.  

### Start/Stop Sub Windows  
---

* `.startSubWindow(name, title=None, modal=False, transient=False, blocking=False)` & `.stopSubWindow()`  
    Used to start and stop defining a *SubWindow*  
    Setting a `title` will override the `name` as a title for the *SubWindow*.  
    Setting `modal` to True, will prevent the user from interacting with the parent window until the *SubWindow* is closed.  
    Setting `transient` to True, will cause the *SubWindow* to respond to parent window events such as hide, show & move.  
    Setting `blocking` to True, will stop execution of your code once the *SubWindow* is shown, until the user closes it.  

* `.openSubWindow(title)`  
    Used to reopen the named *SubWindow*.  
    This lets you modify SubWindows in a different part of the code, for example in a function call.  

### Show/Hide Sub Windows  
---

* `.go(startWindow=None)`  
    If you set a *SubWindow* as the ```startWindow``` *appJar* will start-up showing the named *SubWindow*.  
    The main window will be minimized.  

```python
def login(btn):
    app.hideSubWindow("Login")
    app.show()

app.startSubWindow("Login")
app.addLabel("l2", "Login Window")
app.addButton("SUBMIT", login)
app.stopSubWindow()

app.go(startWindow="Login")
```

* `.showSubWindow(title, hide=False)`  
    Will cause the specified *SubWindow* to be shown.  
    If it is set as *modal* the parent window will become uninteractive until the *SubWindow* is closed.  
    If `hide` is set to True, all other *SubWindows* will be hidden.  

* `.showAllSubWindows()`  
    Will show all *SubWindows*.  

* `.hideSubWindow(title, useStopFunction=False)` & `.confirmHideSubWindow(title)`  
    Used to hide the specified *SubWindow*.  
    This will not destroy the *SubWindow*, so it can be shown again later.  
    By default it bypasses any `stopFunction`.  
    Set `useStopFunction` to be True or call `.confirmHideSubWindow()` to use the `stopFunction`.  

* `.hideAllSubWindows(useStopFunction=False)`  
    Will hide all *SubWindows*.  
    Set `useStopFunction` to be True to use the `stopFunction`.  

* `.destroySubWindow(title)`  
    This will hide and permanently destroy the specified *SubWindow*.  
    It cannot be shown again.  

* `.destroyAllSubWindows()`  
    This will hide and permanently destroy all *SubWindows*.  

It's useful to be able to create a button that stops a SubWindow:  
If you define a button, that calls `.hideSubWindow()` or `.destroySubWindow()`, and give it the same name as the *SubWindow*, then it will hide/destroy the *SubWindow*, and call any associated `.stopFunction()`.  

```python
app.startSubWindow("Demo")
app.addLabel("l1", "Press the button to close this window")
# set the button's name to match the SubWindow's name
app.addNamedButton("CLOSE", "Demo", app.hideSubWindow)
app.stopSubWindow()
```
### Set Sub Windows  
---

Note, all functions available on the main window are also available on *SubWindows*.  
Simply call those functions after starting a *SubWindow*.  

```python
app.startSubWindow("one", modal=True)
app.setBg("orange")
app.setSize(400, 400)
app.setTransparency(25)
app.setStopFunction(checkDone)
app.addLabel("l1", "In sub window")
app.stopSubWindow()
```

### Empty Sub Windows
---
If you want to remove all widgets from a *SubWindow* and repopulate it, you can use the `empty` function.  

* `.emptySubWindow(name)`
    This will empty (delete all widgets) the named *SubWindow*  

Or, you can empty the *SubWindow* whilst it's open:

* `.emptyCurrentContainer()`
    This will empty (delete all widgets) the current container.  

``` python
app.startSubWindow("one", modal=True)
#Â first, delete any widgets in this SubWindow
app.emptyCurrentContainer()
app.setBg("orange")
app.setSize(400, 400)
app.setTransparency(25)
app.setStopFunction(checkDone)
app.addLabel("l1", "In sub window")
app.stopSubWindow()
```
