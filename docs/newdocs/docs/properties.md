# Properties  
---

appJar includes a number of properties that can be configured to change how the GUI looks/acts.  
These are exposed as **properties**, so can be set uing the assignment operator, `=`.  

```python
app.title = "Property Demo"
app.bg = "red"
app.fg = "yellow"
```

If you want to set multiple properties at once, there is a `configure()` function to support this:

* `.configure(**kwargs)`  

```python
app.configure(bg='red', fg='yellow', font={'size':20, 'family':'Helvetica'})
```

Nearly all properties can be got in the same way:  

```python
app.label('sizeLab', app.size)
app.label('locLab', app.location)
app.label('transLab', app.transparency)
```
